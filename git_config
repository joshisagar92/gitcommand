git config --global core.askpass  (fatal: could not read password for URL)
git config --global core.editor   (Set editor to type commit message)
$ git config --global alias.co checkout (give an alias to checkout command.)

technique can also be very useful in creating commands that you think should exist. For example, to correct the usability problem you encountered with unstaging a file, you can add your own unstage alias to Git
$ git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'
